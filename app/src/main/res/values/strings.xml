        Y1 to accept and rate me as low risk\n

        Y3 to accept and rate me as high risk\n
        No to decline\n

        Low Risk allows me to turn off my own wellness checks\n
        Medium Risk requires permission from one of my Emergency Contacts to turn off wellness checks\n
        High risk requires permission from all of my Emergency Contacts to turn off wellness checks
